My name is Carmen and I am a visual creator. I am passionate about expressing and visualizing my own experiences that are related to my heritage. My culture/identity of being Chinese within America has allowed me to see how juxtaposing both cultures are, which inspires the different facets of identity I like to explore. As someone who was brought into this world by immigrant parents and mainly raised by an only Chinese speaking grandmother, I found inspiration in their struggles of assimilation. The dialectics of my culture and upbringing influence much of what I choose to express and continue to create.
